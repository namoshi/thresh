def threshold_kurita(image, nbins=256):
    """Return threshold value based on Kurita's method.
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : (N, M) ndarray
        Grayscale input image.
    nbins : int, optional
        Number of bins used to calculate histogram. This value is ignored for
        integer arrays.
    Returns
    -------
    threshold : float
        Upper threshold value. All pixels with an intensity higher than
        this value are assumed to be foreground.
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
         If ``image`` only contains a single grayscale value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage.data import camera
    >>> image = camera()
    >>> thresh = threshold_kurita(image)
    >>> binary = image <= thresh
    Notes
    -----
    The input image must be grayscale.
